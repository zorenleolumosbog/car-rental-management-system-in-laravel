# Car Rental Management System Project in Laravel

Car Rentals Agency is a web application built using the Laravel framework and core PHP, with expressive and clean syntax. To be really meaningful, we believe development must be a fun and creative experience. Car Rental Agency takes the hassle out of renting a car by making routine chores in the agency easier, such as: Customer registration: New users should be able to register online and print a membership card. Car reservation online: Customers should be able to book and reserve automobiles online using the system. Automatic database update if a reservation is made or a new customer is registered. The system should be able to update the database without any further effort from the administrator whenever a new reservation or registration is made. Customer feedback: There should be a way for customers to provide feedback.
